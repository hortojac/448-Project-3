<h1> Our Project: Game Suite </h2>
<p>- We are developing a game suite, stocked with 5 fun and exciting games to play:</P>
<ol>
    <li>BlackJack</li>
    <li>Connect 4</li>
    <li>Tic-Tac-Toe</li>
    <li>Wordle</li>
    <li>Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock</li>
</ol>

<h2>BlackJack

<h2>Connect 4

<h2>Tic-Tac-Toe

<h2>Wordle

<h2>Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
    <p>A spin on the classic "rock paper scissors", "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" is a more complex twist on the game adapted from the TV show "The Big Bang Theory". The Rules for what wins against what is nicely illustrated with the following image:<p>

### Story Point Estimation

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 8 | 13 | 
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | 
|Importing Project|Creating minigame classes ||RPSLS prototype|Connect 4 prototype|UML Diagram for Project 3|
|Dividing tasks|Barebones code for minigames||Tic-Tac-Toe prototype|Wordle prototype|Design Paradigm|
|Determining projected hours|Linking minigames to menu screen||BlackJack prototype|Software Architecture|Project Design Pattern|

#### Reasoning for estimation:
- We set each story point to have a time value of 20 minutes
- Since project 3 is just prototyping, we knew that the overall hours necessary to complete would be significantly lower, and that the heavy lifting would come into play during Project 4, where we will be fully implementing and polishing our games
- Overall, the documentation for Project 3 actually should take longer than the code, since we want to be very specific on the specifications for our finished Project before development goes into full swing (i.e. when Project 4 begins)
